:::info Stack
1. a pile of objects, typically one that is neatly arranged
2. ```computing``` a data structure in which the last item stored is the first retrieved
3. ```computing``` a set of developer tools and technologies used to build an app
:::

:::info cache
1. a secure hiding place, especially for preserving provisions or implements
2. ```computing``` an auxiliary memory from which high-speed retrieval is possible
:::

This site is intended to serve as a cache of resources for any tech stack weary travelers may encounter along the ils developer's path. We set out on our quest, equipt with the holy [docs as code philosophy](https://www.writethedocs.org/guide/docs-as-code/), prepared to slay the mighty Docusaurus. 

Further topics may include: 
- ```Sierra Rest API```
- ```JavaScript``` 
- ```Node``` 
- ```Gatsby``` 
- ```Python```
- ```SQL```
- ```Google Cloud```
- ```Firebase``` 

Who knows? I may go mad and venture into the dark arts of ```Sierra print templates``` or ```load tables``` too.

I've never been a blogger, but I hope to become better at creative and [technical writing](https://developers.google.com/tech-writing) and practice using GitHub at the same time. [Collaborators are welcome](./docs/getting-started/contribute)! 

This site is built with [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/), a static site generator that's designed for creating documentation sites. It's built with React and powered by Markdown and JSX. Cool!

I've recently been using Docusaurus to develop some internal documentation and really enjoy it The ILS Underground community has been so helpful to me, so I wanted to share an example.

Thanks everybody!
